Map is an interface while HashMap is a class

Linked HashMap vs HashMap
linked maintains the order of insertion
while other does not

TreeMap is implemented as a red black tree

there is a Collection Interface in java
as well as a Collectoins Class in java

HashMap allows NULL keys while HashSet does not. this is a key difference.

Collection -> Set -> HashSet -> LinkedHashSet
                  -> SortedSet -> NavigableSet -> TreeSet

Collection -> List -> ArrayList
                   -> Vector
                   -> LinkedList
    
Collection -> Queue -> LinkedList
    
List keeps the index of the object. it is similar to array.

ArrayList is a growable array. it is dynamic.
    
vector is threadsafe while ArrayList is not

LinkedList in java is doubly circular LinkedList

Queue is implemented using LinkedList eg Queue<student> q = new LinkedList<student>();

Stack is also available in java in java.util.Stack
